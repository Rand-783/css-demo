          <h2>My hobbies</h2>
          <p class="intro"> My first favourite hobby is cooking, and because of my grandmother, I know how to cook all kinds of dishes and our traditional food. I started cooking when I was 11 years old. I always stand next to my mom while she is cooking and learns more about food.
            My second favourite hobby is swimming, and swimming is the best sport that takes all my positive power. I quit swimming when I was 16 years old because I started to wear my hijab put tell this moment I like to swim and do the activity even if I went to a swimming pool only for girls.</p>
